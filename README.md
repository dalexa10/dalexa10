### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dario, a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana Champaign collaborating at the [ESDL](http://systemdesign.illinois.edu/home/).
I am currently working on implementing Multdisciplinary Design Optimization methods to the design of scramjets at [CEESD](https://ceesd.illinois.edu/).
You can follow my previous work and publications here [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dario-Rodriguez-5), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ou120RAAAAAJ)

My interests range from computer science topics like high performance computing, numerical optimization and machine learning to aeropsace subjects like aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization that integrate aerodynamics, propulsion and performance.

I'm profficient in Python (best language ever, isn't it?), Matlab, Latex, Shell. Currently improving my Git, Fortran and C++ skills.

Hobbies: mobile robotics (try ROS!), fixed-wing UAVs (Design: OpenVSP, SUAVE - Hardware: Pixhawk)
