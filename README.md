### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dario, a Aerospace Engineering PhD student at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana Champaign working at [ESLD](http://systemdesign.illinois.edu/home/).
I am currently working on implementing Multdisciplinary Design Optimization methods to the design of scramjets at [CEESD](https://ceesd.illinois.edu/).

My interests range from computer science topics like high performance computing, numerical optimization and machine learning to aeropsace subjects like aircraft multidisciplinary design (aerodynamics, propulsion, performance...)

Profficient in Matlab, Python, Latex, Shell. Currently improving my Git, Fortran and C++ skills.
