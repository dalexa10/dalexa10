### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dario, a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana Champaign collaborating at the [ESDL](http://systemdesign.illinois.edu/home/).
I am currently working on implementing Multdisciplinary Design Optimization methods to the design of scramjets at [CEESD](https://ceesd.illinois.edu/).
You can follow my previous work and publications here [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dario-Rodriguez-5), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ou120RAAAAAJ)

My interests range from computer science topics like high performance computing, numerical optimization and machine learning to aeropsace subjects like aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization that integrate aerodynamics, propulsion and performance.

I'm profficient in Python (best language ever, isn't it?), Matlab, Latex, Shell, Git. Currently learning CUDA C, Fortran and C++.



Hobbies: mobile robotics (try ROS!), fixed-wing UAVs (Design: OpenVSP, SUAVE - Hardware: Pixhawk)  

Here are some stats:

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing a MDAO methodology on the design process of a hypersonic ramjet (Scramjet) by using the NASA software [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/main.html), a modified version of [PyCycle](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/pyCycle) and [MirgeCOM](https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/mirgecom), isn't that cool?
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CUDA with C and C++ and TensorFlow
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that involves Design Optimization / Robotics
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Parallel Programming seems to be a challenging topic!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about programming tips with Python, Matlab, Arduino
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Blending Aerospace and Computer Science topics is inspiring
